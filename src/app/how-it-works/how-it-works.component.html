    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    My website is a Static Hosted Website on S3 built using Angular in a GitHub
    Repo. To deploy this app in AWS the following services will be used: * Code
    Pipeline * Code Build * S3 Bucket

    Alot of directions here are pulled from
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html
    <h3>Create S3 Bucket</h3>
    To create your buckets for website hosting
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
        https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create your root domain:

          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Configure S3 Bucket</h3>

      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
      Github
    </h2>
    Before creating the Angular application, login and create a GitHub
    repository
    <h2>Angular</h2>
    <p>
      Navigate to the directory that will contain the project code and clone the
      recently created GitHub Repo..
    </p>
    <p>
      The application itself is a simple angular app that can be generated using
      <b><code> ng g app MyApp</code></b
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: If the <span>command not found: ng</span> error is not found, run
      the following command <b><code>npm install -g @angular/cli </code></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the app is created, add the buildspec.yml to the root of the folder
      with the following code:
    </p>

    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <img class="buildspec" src="/assets/images/carbon.svg" alt="" />

    <p>
      Once the buildspec file has been added to the project, commit the file and
      push it to the repository
    </p>
    <h2>AWS - CodePipeline</h2>
    <p>To create a CodePipeline Pipeline</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodePipeline console
        at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines
      </li>
      <li>
        Create CodePipeline
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            Click Create Pipeline and fill out the Pipeline Name; Leave the
            Service Role default selection
          </li>
          <li>For the Source Stage, select GitHub</li>
          <li>
            After Connecting to GitHub, pick the GitHub Repo created, and select
            Master as the branch. Leave the default. Change detection options
          </li>
          <li>For the Build Stage, select the AWS CodeBuild as the Build Provider</li>
          <li>Select a region. Note: The region selected should the same as the region the bucket exists</li>
          <li>For the project name, click Create Project</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>AWS - CodeBuild</h2>
    <p>Note: There are two ways to access the CodeBuild Service. Either through the CodePipeline stage or through the Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects?region=us-east-1 Additionally, the CodeBuild form displayed will differ, based on where the form is accessed from.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Fill out Project Name and Description
        </li>
        <li>FOr the Environment Section, keep Environment Image default selection. For the Operating System, I made the following selections:

                <li>Operating System: Ubuntu</li>
                <li>Runtime: Standard</li>
                <li>Image: aws/codebuild/standard:3.0</li>
