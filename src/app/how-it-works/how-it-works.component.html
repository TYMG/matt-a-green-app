    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    My Website is a Static Hosted Website on S3 built using Angular in a GitHub
    Repo.
    <p>To deploy this app in AWS the following services will be used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code Pipeline</li>
      <li>Code Build</li>
      <li>S3 Bucket</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Below is the steps to build this simple App. Please note, a lot of the
      direction have been aggregated from AWS Documentation. Check out the
      sources I used below for more details

    <h2>AWS - S3</h2>

    <h3>Create S3 Bucket</h3>
    To create your buckets for website hosting
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
        https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.
      </li>
      <li>
        Name and Region: Under Bucket name, enter a name for your bucket.
        <i>ex: MyAppBucket</i>. Under Region, enter select a region
      </li>
      <li>Properties: Leave default selections</li>
      <li>
        Set Permissions: Uncheck the <i>Block all public access</i>

        <p>
          What does Public mean? Everyone everyone access to one or more of the
          following: List objects, Write objects, Read and write permissions.
          While this is terrible, this will be fixed shortly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Accept the selected settings and create the bucket, choose Create.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Configure S3 Bucket</h3>
    <h4>Enable Static Website Hosting</h4>
    <p>
      To host a static website on Amazon S3, an Amazon S3 bucket has to be
      configured for website hosting. To configure your bucket for website
      hosting
    </p>
    <p>To configure your bucket for website hosting</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the Amazon S3 console, in the S3 buckets list, choose the created for
        this project. <i>ex: MyAppBucket</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose Properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose Static website hosting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose Use this bucket to host a website.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Index Document box, enter index.html Note: If you don't enter the
        name of your index page, the Save button won't become active, and you
        won't be able to configure your bucket for static website hosting.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Make the S3 Bucket Visable</h4>
    <p>
      While the bucket is has Static Wed Host Enabled, the site will not work
      with making the Bucket Items Public
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this, a bucket policy needs to be created for the Site bucket. To do
      so:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the Amazon S3 console, in the S3 buckets list, choose the created for
        this project. <i>ex: MyAppBucket</i>
      </li>
      <li>Click Permissions</li>
      <li>Click Bucket Policy</li>
      <li>
        Inside the bucket policy, enter the following
        <pre>
        <code>
            &#123; 
                &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,
                &quot;Id&quot;: &quot;Policy1583883712535&quot;,
                &quot;Statement&quot;: [
                    &#123; 
                        &quot;Sid&quot;: &quot;Stmt1583883678671&quot;,
                        &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,
                        &quot;Principal&quot;: &#123; 
                            &quot;AWS&quot;: &quot;*&quot;
                        &#125; ,
                        &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;s3:GetObject&quot;,
                        &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:s3:::s3-ng-app/*&quot;
                    &#125; 
                ]
            &#125; 
        </code>
    </pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        Click 'Save'. Note when the bucket policy is saved, a warning prompt is
        displayed. This expected and not a security issue. Do to the concept of
        "least-privilge", while the bucket items are readable, theyre are not
        editable.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
      Github
    </h2>
    Before creating the Angular application, login and create a GitHub
    repository I'm going to skip the details of this step, but when creating the
    repository, it's important that the repository is not initiated with a
    Readme file. If a Readme is created, it will cause conflicts with the
    Angular CLI Show error picture

    <h2>Angular</h2>
    <p>
      Navigate to the directory that will contain the project code and clone the
      recently created GitHub Repo..
    </p>
    <p>
      The application itself is a simple angular app that can be generated using
    </p>

    <pre><code> ng new s3-ng-app --directory &#123;name of directory&#125;  </code></pre>

    Note: the purpose of the --directory flag is to avoid the angular CLI
    creating a directory for the App.
    <p>
      Note: If the <span>command not found: ng</span> error is not found, run
      the following command <b><code>npm install -g @angular/cli </code></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the app is created, add the buildspec.yml to the root of the folder
      with the following code:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        version: 0.2

        env:
        variables:
          S3_BUCKET: &quot;MyAppBucket&quot; //Should be the name of S3 bucket created
      APP_NAME: &quot;MyApp&quot; //The name of the Angular App created
      BUILD_ENV: &quot;prod&quot;
      
      phases:
        install:
          runtime-versions:
            nodejs: 10
          commands:
            # Install Angular CLI, If you are not using Angular 6, install angular/cli@1.7.0 or lower, confirm by running ng -v inside your project folder
            - npm i -g @angular/cli@6.0.8
            # Install node dependancies.
            - npm i
      
        build:
          commands:
            # Builds Angular application. You can also build using custom environment here like mock or staging
            - echo Build started on `date`
            - ng build --$&#123;BUILD_ENV&#125;
      
        post_build:
          commands:
            # Clear S3 bucket.
            - aws s3 rm s3://$&#123;S3_BUCKET&#125; --recursive
            - echo S3 bucket is cleared.
            # Copy dist folder to S3 bucket, As of Angular 6, builds are stored inside an app folder in distribution and not at the root of the dist folder
            - aws s3 cp dist/$&#123;APP_NAME&#125;/* s3://$&#123;S3_BUCKET&#125; --recursive
            - echo Build completed on `date`
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      Once the buildspec file has been added to the project, commit the file and
      push it to the repository
    </p>

    <h2>AWS - CodePipeline</h2>
    <p>To create a CodePipeline Pipeline</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodePipeline console
        at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines
      </li>
      <li>
        Create CodePipeline
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            Click Create Pipeline and fill out the Pipeline Name; Leave the
            Service Role default selection of New Service Role. Feel free to
            change the Role Name, but makes sure the name can easily be
            remembered. Leave the check box checked for allowing the pipeline to
            create a service role. Click next.
          </li>
          <li>For the Source Stage, select GitHub</li>
          <li>
            AWS will need premission to access GitHub, Click the Connect to
            Github button and authenticate access. After Connecting to GitHub,
            pick the GitHub Repo created for this project, and select Master as
            the branch. Leave the default change detection options. Click Next
            Note: It's not neccessary to use the Master branch for the GitHub Hooks, any branch can be used.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the Build Stage, select the AWS CodeBuild as the Build Provider
          </li>
          <li>
            Select a region. Note: The region selected should the same as the
            region the bucket exists
          </li>
          <li>For the project name, click Create Project</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>AWS - CodeBuild</h2>
    <p>
      Note: There are two ways to access the CodeBuild Service. Either through
      the CodePipeline stage or through the Console:
      https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects?region=us-east-1
      Additionally, the CodeBuild form displayed will differ, based on where the
      form is accessed from.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill out Project Name and Description
      </li>
      <li>
        FOr the Environment Section, keep Environment Image default selection.
        For the Operating System, I made the following selections:
        <ul>
          <li>Operating System: Ubuntu</li>
          <li>Runtime: Standard</li>
          <li>Image: aws/codebuild/standard:3.0</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        For Service Role, keep the default selection, New service role. Remember
        the name of the Service Role created for the CodeBuild, it will be
        needed for a later section.
      </li>
      <li>
        For Buildspec Section, keep the default selection, unless the
        application's buildspec name is different than 'buildspec.yaml'
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave the rest of the default selections and Click 'Continue to
        CodePipeline'
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>AWS - CodePipeline (Cont.)</h2>
    To wrap up the CodePipeline creation process,
    <ol>
      <li>After creating the CodeBuild project, click Next</li>
      <li>
        The pipeline will not need a Deploy Stage, so click 'Skip deploy stage'
      </li>
      <li>On the CodePipeline review page, click 'Create Pipeline'</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>AWS - S3 Bucket Permision</h2>
    The last important step is to update the newly created S3 Bucket with
    additional permissions for the CodeBuild IAM Role
    <ol>
      <li>
        Locate the IAM Role created the CodeBuild Project. If you didnt save it,
        head to IAM Console
        https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/home
      </li>
      <li>On left side nav, click Roles</li>
      <li>
        On the Roles page, search for CodeBuild Role, the default naming
        convention should be: <pre>
            <code>
                code&#45;&#123;name of code pipeline project&#125;&#45;cb&#45;service&#45;role
            </code>
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
          Click the link of the Service Role and copy the Role ARN
      </li>
      <li>Navigate back to the S3 bucket created, click Permissions, then click Bucket Policy</li>
      <li>Add the following to the bucket policy 

        <pre><code>
            &#123;
                &quot;Sid&quot;: &quot;Stmt1565052307205&quot;,
                &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,
                &quot;Principal&quot;: &#123;
                    &quot;AWS&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:iam::170172180887:role/service-role/codebuild-s3-ng-app-cb-service-role&quot;
                &#125;,
                &quot;Action&quot;: [
                    &quot;s3:DeleteObject&quot;,
                    &quot;s3:GetObject&quot;,
                    &quot;s3:PutObject&quot;
                ],
                &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:s3:::mattagreen.com/*&quot;
            &#125;
        </code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>Click Save</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
      Workflow
    </h2>
    <p>Now that the project is setup and configured, it's time to test. Below is the project workflow</p>
    <ol>
      <li>GitHub - A change is made to the Master Branch</li>
      <li>CodePipeline - Source Step picks up change using GitHub Hooks</li>
      <li>CodePipeline - Build Step Calls CodeBuild MattAGreen-CB</li>
      <li>CodeBuild - Using buildspec.yaml file, builds code</li>
      <li>
        CodeBuild - Using buildspec.yaml file, Copy dist folder to S3 bucket,
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>And that's it!</p>
    <h2>
        Testing
    </h2>
    <p>Testing this workflow is simple</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make a change to a file in the Master branch, or whatever branch chosen for the GitHub hooks.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the CodePipeline to track the progress of the build.</li>
        <li>Once the build completes, navigate to the S3 Bucket created for this project.</li>
        <li>The contents of the Angular Project create should be in the bucket. If not, there was an issue with build.</li>
        <li>Click Properties, then click Static website hosting</li>
        <li>In the Static website hosting, click the endpoint link and you should be taken your very S3 Bucket Hosted Angular App!!!</li>
    </ol>
